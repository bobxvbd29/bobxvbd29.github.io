        <h1>SWOT Analysis</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Strengths</h2>
            <p>I have a keen desire to problem-solve and I easily take interest in new activities</p>

            <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
            <p>Procrastination has always had a strong presence in my life but in the last two years I think I have made
                considerable
                progress in getting rid of it completely.</p>

            <h2>Threats</h2>
            <p>My problem with procrastination is definitely a threat that can prevent me from succeeding. I am still
                working on
                getting rid of it and I won't let it stop me. Other than that I do not think there is anything else</p>


            <h2>Opportunities</h2>
            <p>Given my desire to problem-solve I think I will attempt to find an optimal solution to any given task.
