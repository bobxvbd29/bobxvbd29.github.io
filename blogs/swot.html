                <h2>Strengths</h2>
                <p>I have a keen desire to problem-solve and I easily take interest in new activities</p>

                <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
                <p>Procrastination has always had a strong presence in my life but in the last two years I think I have
                    made
                    considerable
                    progress in getting rid of it completely.</p>

                <h2>Threats</h2>
                <p>My problem with procrastination is definitely a threat that can prevent me from succeeding. I am
                    still
                    working on
                    getting rid of it and I won't let it stop me. Other than that I do not think there is anything else
                </p>


                <h2>Opportunities</h2>
                <p>Given my desire to problem-solve I think I will attempt to find an optimal solution to any given
                    task.
