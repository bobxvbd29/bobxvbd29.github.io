                <h2>The Importance of ICTs for Students as a Competence for their Future Professional Performance</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>To date, the knowledge and use of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) has become an
                        almost essential
                        requirement when someone wants to find employment in our society. For this reason, this study
                        aims to analyze the
                        importance that students of the Faculty of Business Studies and Tourism of the University of
                        Huelva (Spain) give to the
                        acquisition of ICT skills for their future professional performance and the domain they have
                        over them (achieved
                        throughout their years of learning). This research is developed through a questionnaire
                        completed by 90 students of the
                        Faculty and concludes that in general they give these ICT skills the importance that they
                        deserve and that their domain
                        goes in parallel (except for some skills that show formative need), even being able to observe
                        that in the majority of
                        cases the dominion of these skills is tied to the importance that they give them.</p>
