            <h2>MOTIVATE YOUR STUDY CHOICE</h2>
            <p>
                I chose this study track because I have always had an interest in programming and ever since I hit
                fourteen it only grew
                stronger. Due to that I chose to study Mathematics and IT extensively during high school. The
                passion I had for
                programming and the one I have right now is even stronger and I really want to pursue a career
                in IT
                and I firmly
                believe ICT is the best choice.</p>

            <h2>AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY...</h2>
            <p> I graduate I expect to start working in the IT field as soon as possible and while in it I
                plan to find a suitable
                position for myself. During my studies in the HZ University I expect to learn how to work in a
                team
                and how to manage
                and work in the IT field
            </p>

            <h2>STUDY CHOICE ACTIVITIES</h2>
            <p>I already have a bunch of friends currently studying at the university and they have told me a
                lot
                of interesting things
                about it. I took a further look into the study programmes and it helped me further solidify my
                choice since I have known
                what I wanted to study for years at this point.
