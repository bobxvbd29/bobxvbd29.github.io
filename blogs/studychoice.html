                <h2>Why I chose ICT</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose this study track because I have always had an interest in programming and ever since I
                    hit
                    fourteen it only grew
                    stronger. Due to that I chose to study Mathematics and IT extensively during high school. The
                    passion I had for
                    programming and the one I have right now is even stronger and I really want to pursue a career
                    in IT
                    and I firmly
                    believe ICT is the best choice.</p>

                <h2>After completeing the programme</h2>
                <p> I graduate I expect to start working in the IT field as soon as possible and while in it I
                    plan to find a suitable
                    position for myself. During my studies in the HZ University I expect to learn how to work in a
                    team
                    and how to manage
                    and work in the IT field
                </p>

                <h2>Factors that went into my decision</h2>
                <p>I already have a bunch of friends currently studying at the university and they have told me a
                    lot
                    of interesting things
                    about it. I took a further look into the study programmes and it helped me further solidify my
                    choice since I have known
                    what I wanted to study for years at this point.
