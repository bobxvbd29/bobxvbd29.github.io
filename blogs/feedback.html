        <h1>Feedback from Shirel</h1>
        <article>
            Your motivation is nice but still a bit too general, why are you interested in programming? What you like
            and still do
            about it? In what way do you believe it can help you? From where the passion is coming from? Why is it the
            best choice?
            What makes you interested in this study program in particular? I recommend you check what interests you most
            about this
            type of career and to search for the true motivation that will keep you going throughout the study program.
            This will be
            very helpful in difficult situations or challenges that you may encounter during your education.

            When looking at your goals after completing the studies again I would recommend you to try and research
            more, maybe
            search the career opportunities that interest you in ICT, what would you like to do in your day to day? How
            would you
            like your role to look like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught. I also
            recommend you
            participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information
            about different
            professions in the ICT field.

            Looking at your SWOT analysis I can see a good start in identifying your strengths and weaknesses, I
            recommend you ask
            yourself what are other strength you may have? Think soft, social, and personal skills. It is good to see
            you admit your
            procrastination and are taking steps to improve this condition, I recommend keeping in mind what helps with
            it, what
            dosent, maybe there are more tools that may help you with it.
